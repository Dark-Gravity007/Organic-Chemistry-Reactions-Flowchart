## 🌟 Overview

Navigating organic synthesis can be overwhelming. This tool serves as a "GPS" for chemical reactions, helping students and educators visualize how different functional groups interconnect.

## 🗺️ What's Inside?

The flowcharts are divided into four primary networks:

1.  **Alkyl Halide Network (R–X):** The central hub for nucleophilic substitution, Grignard reagents, and name reactions like Finkelstein and Swarts.
    
2.  **Carbonyl Group (≥C=O):** Detailed pathways for Aldehydes and Ketones, including Reduction (Clemmensen, Wolff-Kishner), Nucleophilic Addition, and condensation reactions (Aldol, Cannizzaro).
    
3.  **Benzene & Phenol:** Electrophilic Aromatic Substitution (EAS) routes, side-chain reactions of Toluene, and specific Phenol tests.
    
4.  **Aniline & Diazonium Salts:** The "Bridge of Organic Chemistry"—showing how to transform Aniline into various aromatic compounds via Diazonium intermediates.
    

## ✨ Key Features

- **Color-Coded Nodes:** Different colors distinguish between reagents, products, and intermediates.
    
- **Named Reactions:** Over 15+ major named reactions (e.g., Rosenmund, Etard, Reimer–Tiemann) are explicitly labeled.
    
- **Interactive Tabs:** Easily switch between different chemical families without cluttering your screen.
    
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices for quick reference during study sessions.
    
- **Lightweight:** Pure HTML/CSS with minimal JavaScript; zero dependencies.
  

## 🛠️ Development & Customization

The code is written with a focus on CSS Flexbox and Grid for the flowchart logic. If you'd like to add a reaction:

- Reactions are structured in `row` and `branch-indent` classes.
    
- Styling is handled via semantic classes like `.box-green` (alcohols) or `.box-purple` (aromatics).
